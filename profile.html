      <h2 class="section-heading">About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! My name is Roshan Neupane. I am originally from Nepal. I moved to
        Texas in 2014, and since then, I have lived here. I attended the
        University of Texas at Arlington and earned a Bachelor of Science degree
        in December 2021. I enjoy building innovative and robust software
        solutions that cater to clients' needs and exceed their expectations. My
        dedication to problem-solving and logical thinking drives my pursuit of
        excellence in the tech industry. Apart from coding, I love spending time
        with family, playing guitar, engaging in outdoor activities, and
        continuously expanding my skill set to contribute meaningfully to the
        world of web development. Thank you!
